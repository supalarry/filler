# filler
Game where enemies compete who can place more random pieces on the board. The board is fixed and receives piece to be placed until a player gives incorrent coordinate or a piece cannot be placed anymore. The piece is randomly generated by the intermediary virtual machine which hands out board and piece to be placed for player executables.

## Getting Started
Run **make** in root folder and player executable will be created. **players** folder consists of executables ready for the battle. After copying the executable to **resources/players folder**, the game can be launched by running in terminal
```
./filler_vm -p1 players/lskrauci.filler -p2 players/carli.filler -v -f maps/map00
```
The filler_vm hands out random pieces to both players (executables) who need to place as many as they can
while blocking the enemy from doing the same. **-p1** denotes player 1 executable and **-p2** denotes player 2 executable.
maps folder consists of small map (map00), medium size map (map01) and big map (map02)

Here it can be seen that the coordinates were found to be 16 vertically and 3 horizontally.

Next gif illustrates full game. The player who can successfully block or trap enemy has the advantage to continue placing more pieces until no more piece can be placed.
