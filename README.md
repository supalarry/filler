# filler
Game where enemies compete who can place more random pieces on the board.
Run "make" in filler folder and my player executable will be created. After
copying the executable to resources/players folder, the game can be launched by running in terminal
"./filler_vm -p1 players/lskrauci.filler -p2 players/carli.filler -v -f maps/map00"
The filler_vm hands out random pieces to both players who need to place as many as they can
while blocking the enemy from doing the same.
