# filler
The point of this project is to create a champion for a game. For game where enemies compete who can place more random pieces on the board. The board is fixed. One after another each player places random piece on the board until board is full or player is trapped. The piece is randomly generated by the intermediary virtual machine which hands out board and piece to be placed by a player. One player's pieces are represented as 'O's, and other player's as 'X's. The rule is that each piece that is placed, must overlay 1 cell with player's already existing piece. At the beginning of game, one 'O' and one 'X' is placed on the board as starting points for player's next pieces.

```

## Getting Started
Run **make** in root folder and player executable will be created. **players** folder in **resources** folder consists of executables ready for the battle. **resources** folder also stores maps for the game. **resources/maps** folder consists of small map (map00), medium size map (map01) and big map (map02). After copying the executable to **resources/players folder**, the game can be launched by running in terminal
```
./filler_vm -p1 players/lskrauci.filler -p2 players/carli.filler -v -f maps/map00
```
The filler_vm hands out random pieces to both players (executables) who need to place as many as they can
while blocking the enemy from doing the same. **-p1** denotes player 1 executable and **-p2** denotes player 2 executable.
They are going to battle in map00.

## Battle
In the example below a board is given, and it is the move of player 'X' now. Player 'X' receives piece
below. Next, player must specifiy coordinates where to put the piece.

```
000 .................
001 .................
002 .................
003 .................
004 .................
005 .................
006 .................
007 .................
008 ..OOOOOooo.......
009 ...O.............
010 .................
011 .................
012 ..............XX.
013 .............XXXX
014 ..............XXX
Piece 2 3:
.*.
***
```

The player made a move at 12 vertically and 11 horizontally thus placing the given piece on the board.

```
<got (X): [12, 11]
Plateau 15 17:
    01234567890123456
000 .................
001 .................
002 .................
003 .................
004 .................
005 .................
006 .................
007 .................
008 ..OOOOOOOO.......
009 ...O.............
010 .................
011 .................
012 ............x.XX.
013 ...........xxxXXX
014 ..............XXX
```

Next gif illustrates full game. The player who can successfully block or trap enemy has the advantage to continue placing more pieces until no more piece can be placed. Player who places more pieces wins with having the highest score.
